<h1> Should kids have cell phones?</h1>
<p id="kidsphone">
Did you know that a lot of kids get phones around 
8-9 years old? Having a phone has pros and cons. In my opinion, I believe kids should get phones. This essay will talk about why kids should have phones. I have 3 reasons that support my claim to this which are increasing social interaction, teaching responsibility, and contacting parents! First of all, it can increase social interaction! It lets people invite others to places. It has messaging apps (like WhatsApp) so people can stay in touch. And it can help kids who are lonely, make friends. But people have to be careful with who they make friends with online; the internet has strangers all over it and some of them you can’t trust. Another reason is it can teach responsibility, self-discipline and time management. Kids won’t go on it as much; but they might stay on their phone for a while when they get on it. They can also see the time on it, or set alarms. They can also learn when to use it. For example, not using it during study time but using it when you’re done with work. Lastly,  kids should have phones because they can stay in contact with parents. If they are lost, then they can contact their parents for help. They can contact their parents if something changes (like maybe a plan to hangout with friends). Plus parents are able to know where their kids might be. Kids should get phones because it increases social interaction, it teaches responsibility, and they can contact parents. Having a phone as a child has cons and pros but what do you think? Should a child have their own cell phone?
